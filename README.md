## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theposch/gmail-mcp.git
cd gmail-mcp

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a [new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
3. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent):
   - Select "External" user type
   - Add your email as a test user
   - Add the scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail/modify`
4. Create [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type
   - Download the JSON credentials file

### Configuration

Store your credentials securely and specify their location when running the server:

```bash
# Example directory structure for credentials
mkdir -p ~/.gmail-mcp
# Move your downloaded credentials file
mv ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json ~/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Running with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/gmail-mcp",
        "run",
        "gmail",
        "--creds-file-path",
        "/absolute/path/to/credentials.json",
        "--token-path",
        "/absolute/path/to/tokens.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

For testing and debugging, use the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run /path/to/gmail-mcp/src/gmail/server.py --creds-file-path /path/to/credentials.json --token-path /path/to/tokens.json
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Never commit credentials or token files to version control**
- Store credentials in a secure location with appropriate permissions
- The server will request user confirmation before performing sensitive actions
- Review Google Cloud Console regularly for unusual activity
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive paths

## 🛠️ Architecture

This implementation features a comprehensive single-file architecture that handles all Gmail operations through the Google API client libraries. Key components include:

- OAuth2 authentication with automatic token refresh
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Structured tool definitions with clear input schemas
- Efficient email parsing and formatting

## 📚 Example Prompts

Try these prompts with Claude after connecting the Gmail MCP server:

- "Show me my unread emails"
- "Search for emails from example@domain.com with attachments"
- "Create a new label called 'Important Projects'"
- "Draft an email to john@example.com about the upcoming meeting"
- "Archive all emails from newsletter@example.com"
- "Create a filter to automatically label emails from my team"
