## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theposch/gmail-mcp.git
cd gmail-mcp

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```
### Their Stack Setup
1. Get the API credentials from [theirstack](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/api-key) and save it inside `theirstack_api.json`:

```json
{
    "api_key": "your_theirstack_api_key_here",
    "search_preferences": {
        "locations": ["Bengaluru", "Remote"],
        "roles": ["Machine Learning", "AI Engineer", "Data Scientist"],
        "experience_level": "3-7 years",
        "keywords": ["python", "machine learning", "AI", "deep learning"]
    }
}
```

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a [new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
3. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent):
   - Select "External" user type
   - Add your email as a test user
   - Add the scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail/modify`
4. Create [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type
   - Download the JSON credentials file

### Configuration

1. **Store OAuth Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Create directory for credentials
   mkdir -p ~/.gmail-mcp
   
   # Move downloaded credentials file to secure location
   mv ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json ~/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json
   ```

2. **Configure User Profile**
   Update the default user profile in `src/theirstack/server.py` with your details so that you don't have to give it everytime in the prompt:
   ```python
   COMPACT_USER_PROFILE = UserProfile(
       name="AI/ML Engineer",              # Your job title
       skills=[                            # List your technical skills
           "AI/ML", "NLP", "LLM", "RAG",
           "LangChain", "PyTorch", 
           "Python", "FastAPI"
       ],
       preferred_locations=["India", "Remote"],  # Your preferred work locations
       years_of_experience=1,                    # Your years of experience
       experience="Update with your professional experience summary"
   )
   ```

   This profile will be used to:
   - Filter and prioritize job matches
   - Customize job search queries
   - Generate personalized application materials
 
 3. **Update default mail id** 
 Update the default MAil in src/gmail/server.py to your mail id for the backup if LLM doesn't know your mail id.

## üîß Usage

### Running with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\projects\\gmail-mcp",
        "run",
        "gmail",
        "--creds-file-path",
        "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\projects\\gmail-mcp\\client_secret_.apps.googleusercontent.com.json",
        "--token-path",
        "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\projects\\gmail-mcp\\tokens.json"
      ]
    },
    "jobstack": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\projects\\gmail-mcp",
        "run",
        "jobstack",
        "--api-config",
        "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\projects\\gmail-mcp\\theirstack_api.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

For testing and debugging, use the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run /path/to/gmail-mcp/src/gmail/server.py --creds-file-path /path/to/credentials.json --token-path /path/to/tokens.json
```

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Never commit credentials or token files to version control**
- Store credentials in a secure location with appropriate permissions
- The server will request user confirmation before performing sensitive actions
- Review Google Cloud Console regularly for unusual activity
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive paths

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

This implementation features a comprehensive single-file architecture that handles all Gmail operations through the Google API client libraries. Key components include:

- OAuth2 authentication with automatic token refresh
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Structured tool definitions with clear input schemas
- Efficient email parsing and formatting

## üìö Example Prompts

Try these job search-specific prompts with Claude:

- "Find ML engineering jobs posted in the last 2 days and send me the mail about it."
- "Send me a daily digest of new AI jobs in Bangalore"
- "Draft an application email for the Senior ML Scientist position at Wayfair"
- "Track my application status for recent jobs"
- "Create a follow-up email template for applications with no response"
- "Generate a weekly report of my job search progress"

## üîÑ Daily Job Search Workflow

1. The server automatically fetches new job postings every 24 hours
2. Matches are filtered based on your preferences in `theirstack_api.json`
3. A formatted email digest is sent to your specified email address
4. You can respond with actions like "apply", "save for later", or "ignore"
5. The server helps manage applications and follow-ups automatically

## üìä Job Search Analytics

- Track your application success rates
- Monitor response times from employers
- View job market trends in your field
- Generate detailed progress reports
- Set and track application goals
